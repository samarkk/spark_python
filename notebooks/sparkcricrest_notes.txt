To have the spark rest api example working
create a directory and put cricketers.json in that directory
install npm and in that directory run npm init
then install json-server using the following command
npm install json-server --save
edit the package.json file to include the following line in scripts
jsons: "json-server --watch cricketers.json --port 5000"
then issue:
npm run jsons
so we should have the players stats available over localhost:5000 and use requests to get the data from the simulated rest api that's created
